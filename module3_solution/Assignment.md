# Module 3 Coding Assignment

Here are the steps I had to follow to complete the assignment:
1. My implementation has to be just 1 page for 3 mockups: desktop, tablet, and mobile.
2. My page must include a CSS file. No inline styles allowed. My CSS file should be placed into a css folder under the solution container folder.
3. For this assignment, I had to use Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework.
4. Define desktop, tablet, and mobile views in terms of Bootstrap CSS class prefixes, i.e., md, sm, and xs.

    * Desktop mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap md-based classes
    * Tablet mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap sm-based classes
    * Mobile mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap xs-based classes
5. *Navbar*: Create a navbar that scrolls away together with the page (the navbar should become invisible and is not fixed to the top when I scroll the page down). The navbar should have a company name (i.e., navbar-brand class) called "Food, LLC" that is aligned to the left side of the navbar.
For desktop and tablet view, the navbar should not contain anything else. No other buttons should be visible. 
6. *Navbar - Mobile View*: Create a simple menu button (3 horizontal bars). When the user clicks that button, a dropdown menu should appear. The dropdown menu should contain 3 items: Chicken, Beef, and Sushi.

The dropdown menu should take up the entire width of the browser window. The dropdown menu has a background color set that distinguishes it from the rest of the content.
7. *Page Heading.* The page heading that says Our Menu should be centered within the browser window. I must use a Bootstrap class to accomplish this.
8. Create a single really tall section that will use the Bootstrap Grid and take up the entire width of the browser window (minus some margins, of course) for all views: desktop, tablet, and mobile. To make the section really tall, I can either fill it out with a LOT of text or simply set its height to something like 1000px. It needs to be tall enough to cause scrolling down to be required to view the bottom of the section.
### Optional, ungraded portion is bellow: 
1. The page is very simple. It consists of a page heading and 3 sections (all in one row in the desktop view). Each section contains some text. How the sections are laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window.
2. Each section should be fairly large in height. I can achieve this by either filling it up with a lot of content text or simply setting its height property to something large like 700px. At the end of each section, provide a link that says "Back to Top". This link should jump the page back to "Our Menu" heading.
3. Each section should have an h3-based section heading which should be centered within the section.
4. *Layout*: In the desktop view, each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen. As I make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower.
5. *Layout*: In the tablet view, the first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size. The 3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself.
6. *Layout*: In the mobile view, each section should take up the entire row.
7. Link the menu items "Chicken", "Beef", "Sushi" from the mobile-only menu drop down to jump to the part of the page those sections correspond to.
