# Module 2 Coding Assignment

Here are the steps I had to follow to complete the assignment:
1. My implementation has to be just 1 page for 3 mockups: desktop, tablet, and mobile.
2. My page must include a CSS file. No inline styles allowed. My CSS file should be placed into a css folder under the solution container folder.
3. I am not allowed to use any CSS(or Javascript) framework for this assignment.
4. I must implement the following breakpoints that will be considered desktop, tablet, and mobile. The browser should display a desktop version of the site when the width of the browser window is 992px and above. Tablet view should appear only if the width of the browser window is between 768px and 991px, inclusively. Mobile view should appear only if the width of the browser is equal to or less than 767px.
5. My site is very simple. It consists of a page heading and 3 sections (all in one row in the desktop view). Each section contains some text. How the sections are laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window.
6. *Layout*: In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen. As I make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower.
7. *Layout*: In the tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively), the first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size. The 3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself.
8. *Layout*: In the mobile view (equal to or less than 767px), each section should take up the entire row.
9. *Section title region*: Each section should have a section title region that is always positioned at the top right corner of the section no matter the view (desktop, tablet or mobile).
10. *Spacing*: Note the spacing between sections (both horizontal and vertical). Note the horizontal spacing between the edges of the section and the edges of the browser window. Also, note the spacing between the dummy text in each section and the edges of the section. Lastly, make sure the dummy text is "pushed down" enough so it doesn't overlap the section title region.
11. *Borders and Colors*: Each section should have a background color set to some color. Set the background color of each section title region to some unique color. The background color has to still allow the user to view the text in the section and section title regions. Depending on the color I choose, I may want to change the color of the text so it can be easy to read. Set a black border on both the section and section title region that is 1px thick.
12. (OPTIONAL) I may explicitly set a font-family for the text in my page. Also, set the font size of the heading and section title to be 75% larger and 25% larger (respectively) than the font size of the dummy text.
